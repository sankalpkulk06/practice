- Tree Traversal refers to the process of visiting or accessing each node of the tree exactly once in a certain order. 
- Tree traversal algorithms help us to visit and process all the nodes of the tree. 
    Since tree is not a linear data structure, there are multiple nodes which we can visit after visiting a certain node. 
    There are multiple tree traversal techniques which decide the order in which the nodes of the tree are to be visited.

- Depth First Search or DFS:
    1. Inorder Traversal
    2. Preorder Traversal
    3. Postorder Traversal

1. Inorder Traversal:
    - Inorder traversal visits the node in the order: Left -> Root -> Right
