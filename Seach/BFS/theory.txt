Initialization: Enqueue the given source vertex into a queue and mark it as visited.

Exploration: While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue a node from the queue and visit it (e.g., print its value).
    - For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node:
        - Enqueue the neighbor into the queue.
        - Mark the neighbor as visited.
        
Termination: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.
