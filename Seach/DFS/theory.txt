- This is similar to a tree, where we first completely traverse the left subtree and then move to the right subtree. 
- The key difference is that, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles (a node may be visited more than once). 
    To avoid processing a node multiple times, we use a boolean visited array.

- The algorithm starts from a given source and explores all reachable vertices from the given source. 
- It is similar to Preorder Tree Traversal where we visit the root, then recur for its children. 
- In a graph, there maybe loops. So we use an extra visited array to make sure that we do not process a vertex again.
