- < key : value > pair
- Key must be immutable (eg: cant use a list has a key, but tuple(list[]) is immutable)

Benefits:
- Custom keys are easier for software engineers to work with
- Allows search in O(1), whereas list O(n)

How are they built:
- Hash functions
    France = index 0
    USA = index 0 (COLLISION)
    Japan = index 1
- dicttionaries
